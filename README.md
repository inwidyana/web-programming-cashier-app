This project is a very simple web application that i develop as part of my assignment for web programming course.

I was asked to develop a cashier application capable of storing items only using javascript.
Also the application should be able to calculate total price based on discount, items bought and calculate the change.

Keep in mind that this application is not a full featured cashier application due to the requirements of the assignment.
Due to this some feature that should logically be available on a cashier application is not available such as persistance storage of item inventory, tracking item stock, removing item, etc.

I implemented this application using React + Redux as I was experimenting using redux.
